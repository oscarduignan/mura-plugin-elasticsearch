mura-plugin-elasticsearch
=========================

Integrates Elasticsearch with Mura CMS (separate project from blueriver/MuraElasticSearch)

Created as a learning project for MuraCon EU 2014 presentation (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12OF8i1deFDXKVXjP9bC0S6fEzdgjtoXbvQM8fa4GVek/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000 slides)

Unfinished and untidy, haven't had a moment to collect myself together and tidy this up with a recent string of conferences and obligations so I'm just releasing what I have so far. So it's subject to big refactorings and shouldn't be used as any more than a guide at the moment without further development.
